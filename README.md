Welcome to Word Guesser!
Based on the specification, I felt React and web technologies would be the best option to have a dynamially updating GUI within the time frame.

In order to run the code, first clone the repositiory and install the dependencies:
```
npm install
```
Next, open the vite bundler using the command:
```
npm run dev
```
Entering "o" will open the website in a browser.

If you have any additional questions, feel free to reach out to me. Thanks for your time and consideration.

AWESOME CHANGE
